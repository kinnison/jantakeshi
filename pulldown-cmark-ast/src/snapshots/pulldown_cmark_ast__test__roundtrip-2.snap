# Purpose

This constant covers everything that pulldown-cmark can generate.  If this parses and
can be reconstituted then we're good. [^1]

## Attributes { #name .foo .bar .glug .boo baz=cake wibble }

It's also important to support [reflinks] and [normal links](somewhere)

```
foo bar
```

    indented code block
    which has more than one line
    

<strong>Eww!</strong>

<div class="cake">
Markdown [link](ignored) and **bold** not applied
</div>

# Some mathematics

You can $inline$ it.

Or you can display it: $$ x = 2 
y = 4 $$

# Some Formatting

This block starts with an underlined header.  
We also have a hard break above
and a soft break after.

We can do _emphasised_ text, **strong** text, and ~~struck-through~~ text.

Let's play with tasks next

- [ ] Traditional incomplete task
  
  With some extra text

- [x] Traditional complete task

- \[d\] Task to be dropped

- \[.\] Partially complete task

1. A numbered list
2. [x] done

# Definition lists


First Term
: This is the definition of the first term.

Second Term
: This is one definition of the second term.
: This is another definition of the second term.
# Trailing metadata

foo = "bar"
wibble = [1, 2, 3]

The above is still metadata, as is the below

# We had some funky list issues

- \[D\] should vanish
  even though it's multiline
- \[.\] should become dash
  - Doing more stuff
- [x] Should become F
